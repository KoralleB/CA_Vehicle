# National Household Travel Survey 2017

### Abstract
In this project, our objective is to identify the demographic and socioeconomic attributes of alternative fuel vehicle owners California. For this, we use the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) 2017 dataset. We investigate several different machine learning methods that can handle unbalanced data, such as logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, neural nets, and others. The prediction performance will be assessed with the most important variables for each model. Conclusions about the affecting attributes will be made on a county resolution.

Since less than 10% of the vehicles in California are alternative fuel vehicles, we will treat the unbalanced dataset accordingly, but it might impose difficulties on the analysis. The dataset includes about 25,000 households and we hope that is big enough to achieve good prediction performance.
